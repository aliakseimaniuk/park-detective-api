      'The land which now includes Brecknock Park was first granted to Alexander Humphrey in 1680. The proximity to the Isaac Branch water source provided the opportunity for milling operations. Owners such as John Clayton Jr. and the partnership of Joshua Gregg and Thomas Hanson operated a grain mill on the property. In 1812, Thomas Hanson Howell, a grandson of the previous owner, obtained title to the property. Mill operations continued with changes made in machinery as technology advanced. Descendants of the Howell family owned the property until the late twentieth century.',

A mature evergreen buffer and roadside hardwood buffer have been established on the perimeter of the active recreation areas. The landscape of Kent County’s newest park is intended to provide a public site for recreation and leisure services more typical of regional parks. Along with active recreation, Browns Branch was designed to support the quiet, passive recreation and conservation elements of regional recreation pursuits such as hiking, birding, and personal solitude. A beautiful walking trail has been established which interacts with a uniquely designed wetland boardwalk. This trail terminates in a charming and picturesque public picnic area.',
